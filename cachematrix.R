## This first function makeCacheMatrix caches 
## a matrix that is an object in R.
## Let's us remark that, to be solve, the matrix should 
## be inversible i.e means there is square matrix and det (matrix) different to 0.
## In R, we use solve function as recommended. Also, we assume for
## this assignment that, the matrix supplied is always invertible.

## This functions will help to resolve this specified problem
## makeCacheMatrix is an object that stores a matrix by
## set values of a matrix, get its values and set the inverse
## of a matrix and get the inverse values.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL 
        setMatrix <- function (y) { ## matrix 
                ##
                
        }        
}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
